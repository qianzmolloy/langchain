# Tracing Datasets

This guide provides instructions for how to use Datasets generated from LangChain traces.

Some things datasets are useful for include:

- Compare the results of different models or prompts to pick the most appropriate configuration.
- Test for regressions in LLM or agent behavior over known use cases.
- Run a model N times to measure the stability of its predictions and infer the reliability of its performance.
- Run an evaluation chain over your agents' outputs to quantify your agents' performance.


## Creating a Dataset

Datasets store the inputs and outputs of LLM, chat model, or chain or agent runs
